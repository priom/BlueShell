Operating Systems Project Initial Write-Up

For the shell project, our team has decided to move forward with implementing several features, which will be listed and described as follows.

The first feature we plan to include is piping. Piping will give the user the ability to direct the output of one program as the input of another program all through one line in the shell prompt. This will be useful for tasks that require continued use of data that has been acted upon in some way.

Our second feature will be history. This will allow users to revisit previously inputted commands through a simple key of the up and down arrow keys, thereby eliminating some repetitive typing and command entering.

Tab completion will also be implemented into our command-line interface. This gives users the ability to auto-complete a string in the command with reference to either a file in the current directory or existing shell command, helping the user with long file names, forgotten command names and even cutting down input time in the large scale.

We also plan to have redirection as a feature of our shell. This will allow user to redirect output to files, rather than the command prompt itself. This can be useful for saving output for later through the use of saved files, where the prompt itself can get cluttered.

Our final planned feature is the wildcard feature. Using an asterisk, the shell will recognize this as a special input and create a listing of all items in the current folder, all of which will be used as input for the current program.

Currently, we have the barebones structure of our shell up on the repository. Within the next few weeks we plan to have all these features implemented and working correctly and are planning to divide up the feature coding between our group members.
